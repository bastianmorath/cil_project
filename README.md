## Resources
[This](https://github.com/dariopavllo/road-segmentation) is an example of exactly what we are supposed to do. The technique used can be read in the report within the git repo.

[This paper](http://www.mdpi.com/2072-4292/8/4/329/html) does more broad per-pixel segmentation by using satellite images to classify complete regions. However, this is also applicable for road segmentation.
